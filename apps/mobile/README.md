# Monyvi Mobile App

Expo React Native app for Monyvi.

All dependencies are managed from the root workspace. Run commands from the
repository root unless noted otherwise.

## Running The App

For full setup instructions, local Supabase, Google auth, E2E, database, and
runtime scripts, use the root [README](../../README.md). For day-to-day local
backend development, start from this root flow:

```bash
npm run supabase:start:local
npm run supabase:runtime:setup-local
npm run mobile:local-supabase
```

For Android SMS testing, use a development build rather than Expo Go because the
app relies on native SMS permissions and the generated SMS broadcast receiver.
