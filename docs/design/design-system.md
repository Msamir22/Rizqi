# Monyvi Design System

**Last updated:** 2026-05-10  
**Status:** Implementation-aligned UI and theme guide

This document describes the UI conventions currently implemented in
`apps/mobile`. It also marks known inconsistencies so future work can improve
the system without guessing.

## 1. Design Direction

Monyvi should feel like a trusted personal finance companion: calm, premium,
fast, and practical. The interface should make repeated money workflows easy to
scan and complete, while supporting Arabic, English, dark mode, and mobile
ergonomics.

The design should prioritize:

- Clear financial hierarchy: balances, trends, due items, and actions.
- Low-friction entry: voice, SMS import, quick actions, and concise forms.
- Trust: predictable navigation, explicit review before automated writes, and
  recoverable error states.
- Offline confidence: skeletons and local data should make the app feel usable
  even while sync is happening.

## 2. Theme Tokens

Primary sources:

- `apps/mobile/constants/colors.ts`
- `apps/mobile/tailwind.config.js`
- `apps/mobile/global.css`
- `apps/mobile/context/ThemeContext.tsx`

### Palette

The raw palette includes:

- Nile green for brand and success/action.
- Gold for wealth, metals, and warning accents.
- Slate neutrals for backgrounds, surfaces, text, and borders.
- Red for destructive and expense states.
- Blue/orange/silver/violet/brand colors for supporting use cases.

### Semantic Themes

`lightTheme` and `darkTheme` define:

- `background`
- `backgroundGradient`
- `surface`
- `surfaceHighlight`
- `text.primary`
- `text.secondary`
- `text.muted`
- `text.inverse`
- `border`
- `tint`
- `statusBarStyle`

Runtime theme mode is `light`, `dark`, or `system`, persisted in AsyncStorage by
`ThemeContext`.

### Tailwind Registration

Use NativeWind classes first. The Tailwind config exposes semantic tokens such
as:

- `bg-background`
- `bg-surface`
- `text-text-primary`
- `text-text-secondary`
- `text-text-muted`
- `border-border`

It also exposes selected palette families such as `slate`, `nileGreen`, `gold`,
`silver`, `blue`, `orange`, and `red`.

Known gap: not every color in `colors.ts` is registered in Tailwind. When a
missing palette value is needed, add it to `tailwind.config.js` deliberately
instead of hardcoding the hex in JSX.

## 3. Typography

Primary source: `apps/mobile/constants/typography.ts`.

Fonts:

- Inter for LTR English UI.
- Noto Sans Arabic for RTL Arabic UI.
- Readex Pro is loaded for brand use.

Use locale-aware typography through `getTextStyles()` when a style object is
needed. `textStyles` is deprecated because it is static Inter-only.

Common scale:

| Token         | Size/line height | Use                             |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `h1`          | 28/34            | Major screen hero headings.     |
| `h2`          | 24/30            | Screen headings.                |
| `h3`          | 20/26            | Section headings.               |
| `h4`          | 18/24            | Compact headings.               |
| `body`        | 14/20            | Standard body text.             |
| `caption`     | 12/16            | Metadata and supporting labels. |
| `amountLarge` | 32/40            | Large financial totals.         |

## 4. Shared Class Compounds

`apps/mobile/global.css` defines reusable class compounds:

- `input-label`
- `input-error`
- `subtitle-text`
- `body-text`
- `body-small`
- `caption-text`
- `stat-label`
- `stat-value`

When the same class combination repeats across components, add a compound in
`global.css` rather than duplicating it across files.

## 5. Reusable Components

Use these primitives before creating new local variants:

| Component              | Purpose                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PageHeader`           | Standard screen header with safe-area handling, drawer/back actions, selection mode, and right actions. |
| `TextField`            | Labeled text input with error state and controlled draft behavior.                                      |
| `Dropdown`             | Inline or bottom-sheet selection control.                                                               |
| `OptionalSection`      | Expandable optional form section.                                                                       |
| `Skeleton`             | Theme-aware shimmer loading primitive.                                                                  |
| `ToastProvider`        | Global toast feedback.                                                                                  |
| `SectionErrorBoundary` | Recoverable section-level failure UI.                                                                   |
| `RetrySyncScreen`      | Startup recovery when sync/profile state is unsafe.                                                     |
| `StartupLoadingView`   | Branded startup/account loading state.                                                                  |

`PageHeader` is the default for private screens. Known exception:
`LiveRatesHeader` mirrors PageHeader for a specialized live-rates status layout;
prefer folding future header needs back into `PageHeader`.

## 6. Loading And Progress

Content loading should use skeleton layouts built from `Skeleton`.

Allowed spinner use:

- Short button/action progress.
- Inline action confirmation where content is already visible.

Avoid spinner use for whole-screen content loading. Known debt remains in some
screens, including transactions, recurring payments, and budget detail.

Animations and long-running loops must clean up on unmount. Reanimated infinite
animations should be cancelled when applicable.

## 7. Layout And Safe Areas

Rules:

- Root `SafeAreaProvider` must pass `initialWindowMetrics`.
- Apply top inset once per screen.
- Prefer `PageHeader` for header safe-area handling.
- Avoid nesting `SafeAreaView` inside a subtree that already applied top
  padding.
- Use `FlatList` or `SectionList` for long lists.
- Use `ScrollView` for shorter form/detail content.
- Keep bottom padding aware of tab bars, FABs, and modal sheets.

## 8. Styling Rules

Preferred:

- NativeWind `className`.
- `dark:` variants for theme differences.
- Palette and semantic Tailwind tokens.
- `palette` imports only for component props that require raw color values, such
  as icon color or placeholder color.

Allowed inline style exceptions:

- Dynamic computed values, such as width percentages.
- Safe-area padding from runtime insets.
- NativeWind v4 crash workarounds on `TouchableOpacity` and `Pressable` for
  `shadow-*`, `opacity-*`, and `bg-color/opacity`.
- Third-party component props that do not accept `className`.

Current debt:

- Several `StyleSheet.create` usages remain.
- Some raw hex literals remain.
- Some `ActivityIndicator` content-loading states remain.

Do not add new instances of those patterns unless they are covered by an allowed
exception and the reason is local and obvious.

## 9. Icons And Actions

The current app primarily uses `Ionicons` from `@expo/vector-icons`. Continue
using the active icon system unless a broader migration is planned.

Guidelines:

- Prefer icon buttons for familiar actions.
- Pair icons with text when the action is not obvious.
- Keep destructive actions visually distinct with red states.
- Make modal and sheet actions explicit and reversible where financial data is
  involved.

## 10. Localization And RTL

Monyvi supports English and Arabic.

Implementation:

- i18n resources are namespace-based.
- Translation resources are validated at initialization.
- The root gesture view sets `accessibilityLanguage`.
- RTL changes force an app reload when necessary.
- Use `useTranslation("namespace")` inside functional components.
- Non-component code should use stable codes internally and translate only the
  final user-visible message.

Known debt:

- Root `ErrorBoundary` still calls `i18next.t()` directly. This should be
  replaced with the approved pattern when touched.

## 11. Error States

Use explicit, recoverable error states:

- Root app crashes go to `ErrorBoundary`.
- Section failures should use `SectionErrorBoundary`.
- Startup sync/profile failures use `RetrySyncScreen`.
- Services should return stable error codes where UI needs specific handling.
- Do not expose sensitive backend or financial details in user-facing messages.

## 12. Documentation And Audit Notes

When changing a major screen or shared UI primitive, update this document if the
change affects:

- Theme tokens.
- Shared class compounds.
- Header or safe-area conventions.
- Loading-state patterns.
- RTL/localization behavior.
- Allowed styling exceptions.
